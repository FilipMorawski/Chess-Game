# Chess-Game
My first self-made project in Java. Chess game written for learning purposes.
You can choose between versions for two players on one computer, or network version by switching branches.
In network version you can play through local network. Firstly host should start "Server.jar" and then players should run "Client.jar" and enter host adress to connect (IMPORTANT!: port number is hardcoded - 5353).
